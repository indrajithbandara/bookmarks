Illustrated caps increased usability by marking important passages and guiding readers through the text. Unlike their historic counterparts, drop caps on the Web don’t add value in terms of usability or readability—and they are hard for Web developers to control, often rendering differently across browsers. Yet, front-end designers and clients often want to use drop caps as decorative elements. How should we implement them? Just as scribes, artisans, and early printers had a variety of methods for creating initial capitals, we Web designers have multiple methods to choose from. We can use an image of a letter, create a class to enlarge and place a letter, or use a first-child:first-letter to enlarge and place the first letter of the first paragraph. But which method should we use? Which method remains consistent across browsers? Which is most accessible?","uri":"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/04/03/drop-caps-historical-use-and-current-best-practices/"},{"title":"Drag and Drop and Automatically Send to the Server | HTML5 Doctor","dateAdded":1342248449075798,"lastModified":1342248449075798,"description":"Drag and Drop and Automatically Send to the Server | HTML5 Doctor","uri":"http://html5doctor.com/drag-and-drop-to-server/"},{"title":"ascii.io - Python-powered terminal recording and sharing - The Changelog - Open Source moves fast.
