In an iterative approach to user interface design, rapid prototyping is the process of quickly mocking up the future state of a system, be it a website or application, and validating it with a broader team of users, stakeholders, developers and designers. Doing this rapidly and iteratively generates feedback early and often in the process, improving the final design and reducing the need for changes during development. Prototypes range from rough paper sketches to interactive simulations that look and function like the final product. The keys to successful rapid prototyping are revising quickly based on feedback and using the appropriate prototyping approach. Rapid prototyping helps teams experiment with multiple approaches and ideas, it facilitates discussion through visuals instead of words, it ensures that everyone shares a common understanding, and it reduces risk and avoids missed requirements, leading to a better design faster.","uri":"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/16/design-better-faster-with-rapid-prototyping/"},{"title":"Interactive Wireframe Software & Mockup Tool | Axure","dateAdded":1364532710595222,"lastModified":1364532719823514,"description":"The wireframe software used by 60% of the Fortune 100.

A thorough working knowledge of concepts like chroma, value and saturation is key to creating your own awesome color schemes.
